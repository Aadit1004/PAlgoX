# **PAlgoX**

C++ Parallel Algorithms Static Library

## About the Project

Currently developing a C++ static library focusing on multithreaded algorithms in topics such as searching, sorting, graphs, machine learning, and math. I'm using OpenMP, C++, Catch2, and CLion,
with a big focus on runtime optimization and robust unit testing. You can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/Aadit1004/PAlgoX/blob/main/src/Documentation.md) for the list of methods for the library.
